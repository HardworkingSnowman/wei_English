As your train follows the North Link Railway along the eastern coast of Taiwan, you will
see high mountains on one side and blue sea on the other in an enchanting picture of natural
wonder. Along the way you will enjoy viewing the changes of nature's handiwork. After the
train rolls onto the Lanyang Plain, your eyes will be filled with bright green rice paddy and, in
the distance, the Turtle Island, majestic mountains and deep blue waters.
Besides scenic spots, you can also enjoy a vast range of tribal attractions in the Hualien
and Taitung areas. It is well known that eastern Taiwan has the highest concentration of
aboriginal tribes ( Amis, Puyuma, Atayal, Rukai and Bunun ). Tourists may join a variety of
tribal celebrations staged in Hualien, and the Amis Harvest Festival is the best known. Each
Amis village holds its own festival that lasts for an average of three days in mid-July for
Taitung villages, and in August for Hualien villages. Late in the year, usually in December,
Puyuma villages hold the Monkey Festival in which males of the tribe --in the past-- killed a
monkey as part of young braves' initiation into manhood.
According to the aboriginal language, the tribal name Puyuma means “ together ” and
“ united ”. The Taiwan Railway Administration introduced a new tilting train, “ Puyuma
Express ” (普悠瑪), which was named after the aboriginal tribe in Taitung County. In response
to public expectations, the Puyuma Express started service along the eastern coast in early 2013.
