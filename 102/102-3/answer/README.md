Have you ever experienced burning the midnight oil, studying for an exam due the next
day? This is what Mike is doing now. To stay awake and focused, he has had two cups of coffee
in the last three hours and is now making another. Many people like Mike owe their energy to
coffee, a drink which has become trendy and is accumulating more and more consumers
worldwide. These people say they couldn’t live without coffee, but is it good for us?
A sleep expert at Harvard Medical School thinks that the caffeine in coffee causes us to
lose sleep, which he says is unhealthy. Too often, we consume caffeine to stay awake, which
later makes it impossible for us to get the rest we need. Over the past years, studies have related
higher rates of certain types of cancer and bone disease to caffeine consumption.
Despite these concerns, the general opinion in the scientific community is that caffeine is
not dangerous when consumed moderately. Furthermore, a lot of current research has opposite
findings about caffeine, and suggests that it may, in fact, have health benefits. For instance,
studies show that caffeine can help improve one’s mood. Research has also shown that some
caffeinated drinks have disease-fighting chemicals that can help the body fight a number of
illnesses, including certain types of cancer.
Whether the behavioral effects from caffeine are real or not, getting the burst of energy
from coffee is why the drink is getting more and more popular.
