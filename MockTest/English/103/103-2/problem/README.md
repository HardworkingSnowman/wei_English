Mental and physical health professionals in the United States may consider referring clients
and patients to a music therapist for a number of reasons. It seems a particularly good choice for
the social worker who is coordinating a client’s case. Music therapists use music to establish a
relationship with the patient and to improve the patient’s health, using highly structured
musical interactions. Patients and therapists may sing, play instruments, dance, compose, or
simply listen to music.
The course of training for music therapists is comprehensive. In addition to formal musical
and therapy training, music therapists are taught to discern what kinds of interventions will be
most beneficial for each individual patient. Because each patient is different and has
different goals, the music therapist must be able to understand the patient’s situation and choose
the music and activities that will do the most toward helping the patient achieve his or her goals.
The referring social worker can help this process by clearly communicating each client’s history.
Although patients may develop their musical skills, that is not the main goal of music
therapy. Any client who needs particular work on communication or on academic, emotional, and
social skills, and who is not responding to traditional therapy, is an excellent candidate for
music therapy.
