It is not easy to decide what job to do, but you should find something you love. Try to find a
job that you enjoy and get satisfaction (31) , instead of one you do just for money. (32) you
have graduated from college, you will be spending a great amount of your time working, so it is
quite important to think of what you can enjoy in a job. Whether it is the lifestyle, job duties, or
work relationships, (33) are many parts of a job that you can enjoy. Of course, you most likely
will not find the perfect job (34) . Nonetheless, stay calm and give yourself a chance to (35) parts
of the job you think you like and even parts you are still not sure about. Finding a job you enjoy
will definitely help you develop your career.
```
31. (A) to (B) with (C) at (D) from
* Ans: D
```
記得之前講的關係代名詞嗎?
Try to find a job that you enjoy and get satisfaction from. 試著找到一個妳享受且能得到滿足的工作
1. 這句的 that 就是代表這個 job，所以這句話可以這樣解釋:
Try to find a job. + You enjoy the job. + You get satisfaction from the job. 

2. 原文的 that 是當作受詞用，要怎麼判斷關係代名詞是主詞還是受詞呢? 只能從前後文判斷，下面的例句是把 that 當主詞
ex. Try to find a job that can make you happy. 試圖找到能讓妳開心的工作
例句的 that 就是當主詞用，表示 Try to find a job. + The job can make you happy. 

結論: 
關係代名詞(關代)的考法就幾種變來變去，主詞或受詞，還有該用 that, which, who, whom 哪個(忘記就往前翻)。
```

32. (A) Once (B) Would (C) Either (D) Likewise
* Ans: A

33. (A) any (B) here (C) there (D) none
* Ans: C

34. (A) right on (B) right away (C) right down (D) right out
* Ans: B
```
(B) right away: 馬上， right now: 現在馬上
```

35. (A) experience (B) experienced (C) experiencing (D) experiential 
* Ans: A
```
to 後面通常都接原形(第一態)，但是有幾個常見的 to 要接 Ving:
1. be used to n./Ving: 習慣於 n./Ving
ex. I am used to burning the midnight oil. 我很習慣熬夜
這裡的 burning the midnight oil 是一件事情

☆ 注意!!! be used to n./Ving 有個雙胞胎叫做 used to v.，意思是 過去時常 v.，這裡就要用原形動詞
ex. I used to play with Claudia. 我過去時常和 Claudia 玩

2. be committed to n./Ving: 致力於 n./Ving
ex. I am committed to studying computer science. 我致力於學習資工

3. be devoted to n./Ving: 獻身於 n./Ving
ex. You are devoted to taking care of patients. 妳獻身於照顧病人

4. be addicted to n./Ving: 對 n./Ving 上癮
ex. You are addicted to talking with me. 妳對跟我講話上癮了

結論: to 後面接 Ving 的情況都是可以接名詞的，在這裡的 to 的詞性是介係詞(prep.)
```

Dear Sir /Madam,
Over the past 6 months, the service from the garbage collection truck has been very disappointing. We
have complained to the truck driver, but he has done very little to solve the problems. Therefore, I am
writing directly to your department to request your help.
Basically, there are two problems. The first is that the truck never follows the correct time
schedule. Your notice says that garbage will be collected in our area from Monday to Friday at 6 p.m.,
but the truck always either arrives too early or too late. It has been as much as 15 minutes early and
25 minutes late. The second problem, which is more serious, is that the truck moves off too quickly.
I have seen people running after the moving vehicle almost every time, making a disaster very
likely. What if the person running were pregnant, disabled, or elderly?
As I mentioned at the beginning, we did express our concerns to the driver. The first time we
spoke to him, he was very kind. He explained very patiently that the department was trying to make
a better time schedule. Thereafter, he just started ignoring us. Honestly speaking, I felt this was
very rude of him and unprofessional.
If these problems continue, I am worried that residents will start dropping their trash on the
corner of the street. Therefore, for both the safety and health of everybody, I hope that you will look
into this matter as soon as possible.
                                                                              Yours faithfully,
                                                                              Tsai, Chia-wen
                                                                              tsai.ch@pmail.com
