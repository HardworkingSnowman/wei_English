Dear Sir /Madam,
Over the past 6 months, the service from the garbage collection truck has been very disappointing. We
have complained to the truck driver, but he has done very little to solve the problems. Therefore, I am
writing directly to your department to request your help.
Basically, there are two problems. The first is that the truck never follows the correct time
schedule. Your notice says that garbage will be collected in our area from Monday to Friday at 6 p.m.,
but the truck always either arrives too early or too late. It has been as much as 15 minutes early and
25 minutes late. The second problem, which is more serious, is that the truck moves off too quickly.
I have seen people running after the moving vehicle almost every time, making a disaster very
likely. What if the person running were pregnant, disabled, or elderly?
As I mentioned at the beginning, we did express our concerns to the driver. The first time we
spoke to him, he was very kind. He explained very patiently that the department was trying to make
a better time schedule. Thereafter, he just started ignoring us. Honestly speaking, I felt this was
very rude of him and unprofessional.
If these problems continue, I am worried that residents will start dropping their trash on the
corner of the street. Therefore, for both the safety and health of everybody, I hope that you will look
into this matter as soon as possible.
                                                                              Yours faithfully,
                                                                              Tsai, Chia-wen
                                                                              tsai.ch@pmail.com
