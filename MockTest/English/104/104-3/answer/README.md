The concept of a working holiday is fairly simple. It is a vacation which normally lasts
for several weeks or even months, during which you divide your time between work and
recreation. The typical working holiday includes some manual labor and sightseeing. You can
usually get room and board in exchange for a few hours of work. For instance, Australia and
New Zealand encourage working holidays by offering one-year visas to people between
the ages of 18 and 30. Countries all over the world offer the chances to work or volunteer and
live in a new environment. All you need is a return ticket and enough cash to live on.
While some people choose to work in restaurants or hotels, others may do fruit picking
which is perhaps the most popular type of work. Be prepared for long working days
in the orchard, which may last up to ten hours a day. If you are not ready for this, a more
leisurely job with shorter hours is possible, but you will not make as much money.
Another option is volunteering in foreign countries. For example, you can work with
disabled children in Bolivia and practice your Spanish, research dolphins and whales in Italy, or
build schools in rural towns in Ghana.
A working holiday is a great way to broaden your horizons since it gives you the chance to
explore a country, practice a new language, and meet people from all over the world.
These kinds of adventures sometimes have a really big impact on those who have experienced a
working holiday. They often say that it was one of the best memories of their lives. Be aware!
Even though some working vacation programs pay, not all of them do; sometimes you end up
paying to go on working vacation. However, a working holiday can get you off the beaten
track and into spots the average tour bus would never go near.
