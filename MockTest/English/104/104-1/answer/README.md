containers like glass bottles, plastic bottles and aluminum cans can be reused. The more we
recycle, the less trash we will make. To protect the 30 species on earth, we can stop

ornaments that are made of elephant tusks. Without the purchases of the valuable merchandises,
manufactures would cut down the production, and slaughter less precious animals.
