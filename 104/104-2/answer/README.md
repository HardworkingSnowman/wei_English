Ebola virus disease ( EVD ) is a highly contagious disease of humans and other animals
caused by Ebola virus (EBOV). Direct contact with blood or other body fluids of the infected
helps spread the virus. It is believed that African fruit bats are the carriers in nature, which are
able to transmit EBOV to humans, or living or dead animals which have been infected by the
bats. After human infection happens, the disease may become an epidemic, spreading among
humans.
There are a variety of symptoms, such as sore throats, headaches, muscle pains, vomiting,
diarrhea, rashes, and fevers. The symptoms normally begin between two days and three weeks
after contracting the virus. When the worse symptom of diminished function of the kidneys and
liver occurs, some infected humans might bleed both internally and externally. This is a highly
deadly disease, able to kill between 50 percent and 90 percent of those infected with the virus.
The causes of death mainly result from stroke, myocardial infarction, or organ failure.
Unfortunately, there is no specific treatment or confirmatively effective vaccine available for the
virus.
Medical services and prevention are needed to control EVD outbreaks. The medical
services consist of swift quarantine of EVD cases, tracking those who have come into contact
with infected people, appropriate care of the infected, and cremation or burial of the dead.
Prevention requires how to restrain EVD spreading from infected animals to humans. This can
be achieved by wearing protective clothing when humans handle possibly infected wild animal
meat. It is crucial to wash hands with disinfectants when humans stay with those who have
contracted the disease. In addition, body fluids and tissues from the infected individuals have to
be dealt with cautiously.
