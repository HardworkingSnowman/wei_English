A smart phone is a mobile telephone with a display screen, built-in personal information
management programs (such as an electronic calendar and address book) typically found in a
personal digital assistant (PDA), and an operating system (OS) that allows other computer software
to be installed for Web browsing, e-mail, music, video, and other (36) .
The first smart phone was designed by IBM and (37) by BellSouth in 1993. It included a
touch screen interface for accessing its calendar, address book, calculator, and other functions. As
the market matured and solid-state computer memory and integrated circuits became less expensive
over the following decade, smart phones became more computer-like, and more more-advanced
services, (38) Internet access, became possible.
Advanced services became ubiquitous ( 到處存在的 ) with the introduction of the so-called
third-generation (3G) mobile phone networks in 2001. (39) 3G, most mobile phones could send
and receive data at a rate sufficient for telephone calls and text messages. Using 3G, communication
takes place at bit-rates (40) for sending and receiving photographs, video clips, music files, e-mails,
and more.

Most countries ban the buying and selling of organs for transplantation. In the United States
and many others, people may donate one of their kidneys but not sell it on the open market. But
some people argue that such laws should be changed. They point out that thousands of people die
each year waiting for kidney transplants—and that the supply would be increased if there existed a
free market for kidneys. They also argue that people in need of money should be free to sell their
kidneys if they wish to.
One argument for permitting the buying and selling of kidneys rests on the libertarian notion
of self-ownership. If I own my own body, I should be free to sell my body parts as I please. But few
advocates of organ sales actually embrace the full libertarian logic. The reason for this is that most
proponents of markets in kidney emphasize the moral importance of saving lives, and the fact that
most people who donate one of their kidneys can manage with the other one. But if you believe your
body and life are your property, neither of these considerations really matters. If you own yourself,
your right to use your body as you please is the reason good enough to let you sell your body parts.
The lives you save or the good you do is beside the point.
```

(A) supporters (B) opponents (C) bystanders (D) legislators

(C) It is moral to save lives as long as one does not endanger his/ her own.

value.
