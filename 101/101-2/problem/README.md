The phenomenon of undrafted Harvard grad and previous NBA benchwarmer Jeremy Lin is
translating into serious money, as Knicks’ ticket prices soar and stores can’t keep up with demand
for Lin jerseys and “Linsanity” merchandise.
Not long after being let go by two NBA teams (Rockets, Warriors), Lin is the biggest story in
basketball. He’s led the Knicks to five straight wins, highlighted by a dominant, 38-point performance
against the Lakers. In any event, fans can’t seem to get enough of Lin and his “Lincredible”
underdog success story. Since he started his magical run on February 4, Lin’s #17 jersey has been
the NBA’s best seller. Yahoo! Sports also reports that since Linsanity surfaced, Knicks merchandise
sales have been tops in the NBA, sports stores in midtown Manhattan have sold out multiple
shipments of Lin gear, the Knicks have jacked up ticket prices by 27%, and the stock price of the
team ownership (Madison Square Garden Co.) has risen 6.2%.
Apparel manufacturers seem unable to keep up with the surprise demand for Lin gear. The
Knicks Store website currently states that it is sold out of Lin’s home and road jerseys. As expected
in today’s economy, though, when traditional methods come up short, entrepreneurs on the web fill
in the gaps. A “Jeremy Lin” search at eBay yields 6,598 results, including signed playing cards,
jerseys, and T-shirts. At design-your-own merchandise site Cafè Press, there are currently 21
different designs, including Linsanity pajamas and Linsanity iPad cases, both with Chinese lettering.
Lin’s breakout would be a great story no matter what his ethnic background, but the fact that so
few NBA players look like him—his parents are from Taiwan—has boosted the Lin phenomenon to
the next level. And, speaking of Asia, that’s where Linsanity may be its most insane. Reuters and
others note that the biggest market for the NBA outside North America is China. Tens of millions of
Chinese fans have been watching Lin’s highlights on state-run sports channels over the past weeks.
Especially after the retirement of China’s Yao Ming last year, Lin looks to be a crowd favorite—
and a dream spokesperson for all sorts of brands and products.
