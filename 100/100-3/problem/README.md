Time magazine has honored a Taiwanese vegetable vendor Chen Shu-chu as one of the 100
most influential people of 2010. Chen was also selected by Forbes magazine as one of the 48
heroes of philanthropy (善行) from Asia. Out of her modest income, she has donated NT$10
million to charity over the years, including a children’s fund, construction of a library at a
school, and construction of the local orphanage, where she also gives financial support to three
children.
Everyday around 3 a.m., Chen shows up at the wholesale market to pick fresh produce. At
4 a.m., her stall opens for business, and customers are already waiting. She came from a poor
family and was forced to drop out of school at the age of 13 to support her six brothers and
sisters following the death of her mother. Her mother died in labor and her brother died of
illness because her family could not afford medical care. She took over her mother’s vegetable
stand and has been selling vegetables at Central Market in Taitung since 1963.
She makes a small profit of five to ten NT dollars on each sale. The nickels and dimes she
earns are the basis for her charitable giving. Many poor students and families whom she has
never met have had their lives changed by her generosity. Chen Shu-chu is merely a common
grocery vendor. She is not famous. The 61-year-old once told a newspaper that money is not
useful unless it is given to those in need. Her story encourages many people that even though
they may not be rich, their small donations may come as a great help to some less fortunate
people.
